Hello World

I've added a new file.

here is the updated version.

Github update.

2. Diffrence between add, commit, push
For add command, you will stage the unstaged files
For Commit command, you will commit the staged files and need to have commit message in order for us to easily track the changes.
For Push, this will be the last step after the commit, for you to push it in a remote server or local. for the changes to be implemented.
